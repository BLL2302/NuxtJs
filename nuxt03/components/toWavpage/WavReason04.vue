Using a web-based platform is a more efficient option since you can access it using any device and takes up no hard drive space. Plus, not everybody knows how to install software. However, the worst-case scenario if you download and install a YouTube to WAV converter to your computer is the possibility of virus and malware infestation. With an online platform, you donâ€™t usually have to deal with these risks.'
